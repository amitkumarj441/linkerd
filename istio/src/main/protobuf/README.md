**google/protobuf**: Replicated from
[the google protobuf repo](https://github.com/google/protobuf/tree/master/src/google/protobuf).

 `com.google.local` to avoid protobuf-java conflicts.

**google/rpc**: Replcated from [the googleapis repo](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/rpc).

**mixer/v1**: Replicated from [the istio mixer api repo](https://github.com/istio/api/tree/master/mixer).
