**google/protobuf**: Replicated from 
[the google protobuf repo](https://github.com/google/protobuf/tree/2f4489a3e504e0a4aaffee69b551c6acc9e08374/src/google/protobuf).
Ideally we wouldn't need these and could use the protobuf-java library directly. The java packages have been changed to
 `com.google.local` to avoid protobuf-java conflicts.

**proxy/v1**: Replicated from [the istio api repo](https://github.com/istio/api/tree/master/proxy)
